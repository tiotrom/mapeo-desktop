# Mapeo Desktop

[![Build Status](https://github.com/digidem/mapeo-desktop/workflows/Node%20CD/badge.svg)](https://github.com/digidem/mapeo-desktop/actions)

An offline map editing application for indigenous territory mapping in remote
environments. It uses [osm-p2p](https://github.com/digidem/osm-p2p-db) for
offline peer-to-peer synchronization of an OpenStreetMap database, without any
server. The editor is based on [iDEditor](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/),
a simple and easy to use editor for OpenStreetMap. The app is web app built with
[Electron](http://electron.atom.io).

This project is under active development and we are testing it out in the field in Ecuador.
